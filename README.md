## Introduction

**Knowledge Fountain School** is an educational institution dedicated to providing a nurturing environment for academic excellence and character development. Our vision is to create a space where students can not only excel academically but also grow as compassionate, confident, and responsible individuals.

The website serves as a **portfolio** and **landing page** for the school, showcasing its programs, values, and commitment to fostering a community of lifelong learners. Built with modern web technologies, this landing page ensures that parents, students, and educators can easily access key information about our school and its offerings.
